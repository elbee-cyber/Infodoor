# Infodoor
Simple to use backdoor, with two available options. To list files in a specified directory or to send system information. Get backdoor.py to run on target, be sure to configure the path and port before you do so. Connect to backdoor with backdoor_client.py and choose an option! This is my first script, so pardon my horrible programming, I'm relatively new to the game.
